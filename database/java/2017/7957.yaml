title: "Denial of Service on XStream"
description: >
    XStream through 1.4.9, when a certain denyTypes workaround is not used, mishandles attempts to create an instance of the primitive type 'void' during unmarshalling, leading to a remote application crash, as demonstrated by an xstream.fromXML("<void/>") call.
