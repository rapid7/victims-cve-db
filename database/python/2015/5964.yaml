title: "python-django: Denial-of-service possibility in logout() view by filling session store"
description: >
    It was found that certain Django functions would, in certain circumstances,
    create empty sessions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to fill up the
    session store or cause other users' session records to be evicted by
    requesting a large number of new sessions.
