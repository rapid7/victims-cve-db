title: "python-django: Denial-of-service possibility in logout() view by filling session store"
description: >
    It was found that Django incorrectly handled the session store. A session
    could be created by anonymously accessing the
    django.contrib.auth.views.logout view if it was not decorated correctly
    with django.contrib.auth.decorators.login_required. A remote attacker could
    use this flaw to fill up the session store or cause other users' session
    records to be evicted by requesting a large number of new sessions.
