title: "libxml2: stack exhaustion while parsing xml files in recovery mode"
description: >
    Missing recursive loop detection checks were found in the xmlParserEntityCheck() 
    and xmlStringGetNodeList() functions of libxml2, causing application using the 
    library to crash by stack exhaustion while building the associated data. An attacker 
    able to send XML data to be parsed in recovery mode could launch a Denial of Service 
    on the application.
