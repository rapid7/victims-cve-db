title: "libxml2: stack overflow before detecting invalid XML file"
description: >
    Missing incrementation of recursion depth counter were found in 
    the xmlParserEntityCheck() and xmlParseAttValueComplex() functions 
    used for parsing XML data. An attacker could launch a Denial of 
    Service attack by passing specially crafted XML data to an application, 
    forcing it to crash due to stack exhaustion.
