title: "Django: file upload denial of service"
description: >
    The default configuration for the file upload handling system uses 
    a sequential file name generation process when a file with a 
    conflicting name is uploaded, which allows remote attackers to cause 
    a denial of service (CPU consumption) by unloading a multiple files 
    with the same name.
